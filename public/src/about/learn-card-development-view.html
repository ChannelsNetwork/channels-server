        <h1>Developing Your Own Card Design</h1>
        <p>
          Channels presents content in "cards". There are different kinds of cards, each optimized for presenting different kinds of
          content. Anyone with web development skills (HTML and javascript) can create a new card type and use it on Channels.
          You don't need our approval.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Channels card is a
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">web component</a>. Actually, it is a project containing two web component definitions: a "composer" used for composing
          a new card of that type, and a "viewer" used for presenting the resulting card to each consumer of that card.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a Channels user composes a new card, they first select the card type. Using the "custom" option, they can choose a card
          type by entering the location of a project hosted on GitHub. That GitHub project needs to conform to a certain
          structure to be accepted by Channels as valid. So you start a new card design by creating a repository on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it easier to develop your card, Channels provides tools.
          <b>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ChannelsNetwork/channels-card-cli">Start here</a>
          </b> where you'll find complete instructions for creating and publishing your card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the tooling that Channels provides allows you to test your composer and viewer before publishing your card. This
          will save you a lot of time as you iterate the design. When you are satisfied, you need to go to GitHub and create
          a release for your card. Without a release, Channels will not use your design.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are developing a card that you hope others will use, you can declare a royalty that publishers using your card will
          have to pay you. This royalty is declared as a percentage of the revenue earned by a publisher from a card built
          using your design. You can choose the royalty and publishers can decide whether they are willing to pay it. In
          order to get paid, you need a Channels account and will use the address of that account when declaring your royalty.
          Then each time someone opens a card that uses your design, your Channels balance will be increased. You can withdraw
          those funds from your account whenever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some publishers will create their own card designs customized for their own content. One could even create a new card design
          to be used specifically for a single card.
        </p>
