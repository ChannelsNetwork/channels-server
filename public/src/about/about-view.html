        <h1>What is Channels?</h1>
        <p>The web is filled with great content. But most creators are getting paid little or nothing for their work.</p>
        <p>We're going to change that.</p>
        <p>Channels is pioneering a new way for content creators to get paid.
          <b>A simple micro payment site for content</b>. Publish on Channels and earn money for every view.</p>

        <h1>Content on Channels</h1>
        <p>Web content is diverse: videos, photos, articles, apps, games, and much more.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Post whatever content you want</b> using the card best suited to it.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Set the price</b> someone pays you to view it.</p>
        <p>If you have web development skills,
          <b>create your own card design</b>. And collect royalties if others use it to post their cards.</p>

        <h1>Money!</h1>
        <p>Most people resist paying for anything on the web today. We're eliminating their excuses.</p>
        <p>
          <li>
            <b>Pay using tokens.</b> When someone taps on your card, they pay you tokens based on the price you set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't sign in</b> until you want to. Channels provides each user an initial balance of tokens they use to pay
            for the cards they view, even before they sign in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Never open your wallet.</b> Channels provides a way for you to earn tokens. As your balance drops, Channels includes
            promoted cards in your feed. These cards pay you tokens to view them.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>Taken together, you have almost no reason to resist opening (and paying for) any card that interests you.</p>
        <p>Sell the tokens you earn from publishing anytime and we'll deposit the proceeds into your Paypal account.</p>
