        <h1>What is Channels?</h1>
        <p>The web is filled with great content. But most creators are getting paid little or nothing for their work.</p>
        <p>We're going to change that.</p>
        <p>Channels is pioneering a new way for content creators to get paid.
          <b>A simple micro payment site for content</b>. Publish on Channels and earn money for every view.</p>

        <h1>Content on Channels</h1>
        <p>Web content is diverse: videos, photos, articles, apps, games, and much more.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Post whatever content you want</b> using the card best suited to it.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Set the price</b> someone pays you to view it.</p>
        <p>If you have web development skills,
          <b>create your own card design</b>. And collect royalties if others use it to post their cards.</p>

        <h1>Money!</h1>
        <p>Most people resist paying for anything on the web today. We're eliminating their excuses.</p>
        <p>
          <li>
            <b>Pay using tokens.</b> When someone taps on your card, they pay you tokens based on the price you set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't sign in</b> until you want to. Channels provides each user an initial balance of tokens they use to pay
            for the cards they view, even before they sign in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Never open your wallet.</b> Channels provides a way for you to earn tokens. As your balance drops, Channels includes
            promoted cards in your feed. These cards pay you tokens to view them.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>Taken together, you have almost no reason to resist opening (and paying for) any card that interests you.</p>
        <p>Sell the tokens you earn from publishing anytime and we'll deposit the proceeds into your Paypal account.</p>
      </div>
    </section> -->
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>How Does It Work</h1>
        <p>Each person that comes to Channels automatically has an account set up for them with an initial balance of 2.5 tokens,
          which we call
          <b>ChannelCoins</b>. We use the symbol, ℂ, to represent these tokens. So ℂ0.25, for example, means one quarter of
          one ChannelCoin token.
        </p>
        <p>Users see
          <b>cards</b> that others have posted, each with a price tag. When they open a card for the first time (and keep it
          open for at least 10 seconds), a transaction is made between that consumer and the author of that card. Based on
          the card's price, a small quantity of tokens are transferred from the buyer's account to the seller's account.
          Or, if the card's author is promoting their content, that transfer may happen in the other direction.
        </p>
        <p>If your balance is above ℂ5.00, Channels will not show you promoted content. So users who prefer not to see advertising
          can simply purchase tokens to cover the content they consume.
        </p>
        <p>The card's author sets the pricing level on their cards. Channels uses this information to set the final prices,
          so as to keep a balance between how much money is coming into the network and how much is going out. This is what
          ensures that authors are getting paid well, but consumers are not seeing excessive advertising. Channels takes
          10% of the tokens paid from consumers to authors.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike other platforms (like Medium and YouTube), Channels does not support a single type of content. You can post
          videos, articles, games, news, etc. We have built-in card designs supporting the common types. But Channels can
          support virtually
          <a href="/learn-card-development">any kind of content</a> that can be hosted on the web.</p>
        <p>You can sell tokens you have in excess of ℂ5.00. Currently ChannelCoin tokens can be exchanged 1:1 with US dollars.
          Eventually that exchange rate will change.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <div class="question">
          <p class="q">How can someone pay for content before they even sign in?</p>
          <p class="a">Without you worrying about it, Channels is performing these transactions using cryptocurrency techniques. So we
            don't need your identity in order to be able to let you participate in a transaction. We assign each new user
            a unique key and track their balance using that key. You only need to provide your identity when you want to
            post content so that consumers know more about the author of the content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p class="q">How much money can I make?</p>
          <p class="a">There's no limit. You're competing for consumers who will pay you. So post good content. And then share your cards
            with your followers on social media and elsewhere. Channels is still young, so don't expect a huge audience if
            you don't help to bring them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p class="q">Why should I drop my existing system (YouTube, Medium, Vimeo, Patreon, my own site, etc.)?</p>
          <p class="a">You don't have to. We don't require that your content is exclusive. But when telling your followers about where
            to find your content, we encourage you to point them to your content on Channels. They will appreciate being
            able to support you financially in a small way. Your content won't have ads in front of it. And you may very
            well make more money per view than you would have on another platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p class="q">Can I post any content I want?</p>
          <p class="a">No. You should not post content that is not appropriate for a general audience. Also, we take copyright law very
            seriously. You should only post content that you own the rights to use. That includes photos and audio you embed
            in your content. (By searching the web for "free stock photos", you will find sources for content you can use
            without restriction.)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p class="q">As a publisher, do I get a cut of the advertising revenue?</p>
          <p class="a">Not directly. Your viewers are paid by advertisers (unless they choose to keep their balance above ℂ5) and they
            use that money to pay you when they open your cards. Unlike Facebook and Google, Channels does not make any money
            from advertising. All of that money goes to viewers. We do, however, take 10% of the fee when viewers pay publishers.
