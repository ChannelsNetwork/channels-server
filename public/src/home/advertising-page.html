        <h1>Advertising on Channels</h1>
        <p>
          Channels is the easiest, fastest, and most flexible way that an advertiser can get the attention of the people they want
          to reach. We serve up thousands of ads per day to people from around the world.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>Channels is a network where anyone can post any type of content: stories, photos, songs, videos, games, etc. Each
          new member of the network gets their own channel where they can publish their own content.</p>
        <p>Unlike every other network, on Channels every time a person views some content, they pay the publisher, using tokens
          that we call ChannelCoins. Alternatively, the publisher might offer to pay the viewer some tokens -- and that is
          where advertising comes in. The network makes these token exchanges simple, fast, and seamless. </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
        <p>Channels is free and open to everyone who agrees to our terms of service. If you want to advertise on Channels, you'll
          be paying the consumers to view your content. You can choose whether to pay for impressions or clicks. We're keeping
          things very simple -- with fixed prices for each of these: currently 0.02 tokens per impression, or 0.50 tokens
          per click. We use a special symbol, ℂ, for these tokens.</p>
        <p>Since we are still growing, we are currently paying subsidies to advertisers. Every time your ad pays a consumer
          ℂ0.50, we will pay 90% of that amount. So the net cost per click to you currently is ℂ0.05 tokens -- or US$0.05
          per click at current token prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advertisers need to purchase tokens to pay consumers. We sell and buy back tokens at US$1.00. All you need is a Paypal account
          to buy or sell.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>How hard is it to get started?</h1>
        <p>All you need is an email address, an image for your ad, plus a title and description. (But you can make much more
          sophisticated ads if you prefer.) You don't even need to buy coins before getting started. Whenever you see the
          yellow "+" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, tap on it to create an ad. If you haven't already registered,
          you'll need to do that. Then you fill in a bit of information and you're done. You can have your first ad running
          in less than a minute.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Can I target my ads?</h1>
        <p>Yes. You can choose which countries, regions, or states you want to target. Only consumers in those areas will be
          offered to be paid to view your card. If others come looking for your content, they may find it in your channel,
          but you won't pay them to see it.</p>
        <p>We'll soon be adding the ability to target even more narrowly based on consumer interest. You'll be able to choose
          search terms, keywords, channels, and/or cards such that your ads will only target consumers who have demonstrated
          an interest in those items.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>What do ads look like on Channels?</h1>
        <p>On Channels, all content is packaged into "cards". If you visit the Channels
          <a href="/">home page</a>, you're likely to see several promoted card interleaved with content cards. Promoted cards are distinguished
          with a green price tag or symbol in the top-right corner of the card. Otherwise promoted cards look like any other
          content card.
        </p>
        <p>We support a variety of different types of cards for presenting different kinds of content. There are cards for showing
          video, audio, stories, games, etc. There is even an "ad" card that just links from the consumer's feed directly
          to any web page you designate.</p>
        <p>You can choose whether you want to pay consumers to come directly and visit your site, or pay them to view some content
          that you post inside a card on Channels itself. In the latter case, you can use any card that Channels supports
          depending on the nature of your ad content.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>How should I feel about consumers being paid to view ads?</h1>
        <p>First, the only thing consumers can do with tokens they earn from advertisers is to spend them on content. So you
          don't need to worry about people trolling ads to earn money.</p>
        <p>Second, our informal studies show that consumers are much happier about ads when they know they are being compensated
          to view them. They start to see the advertiser as their friend rather than as an annoyance.</p>
        <p>Third, consumers are presented with a lot of advertising opportunities on Channels. This means that they can pick
          and choose the ads that offer the most interesting content to them. That means viewers will usually be more qualified,
          rather than less.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section style="padding-bottom: 80px;">
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Try it right now!</h1>
        <p>Why wait? Follow these steps to publish an ad card that links to your website:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Tap on the yellow "+" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen</li>
          <li>If you haven't already registered, you'll be asked to do that next</li>
          <li>In the compose wizard, choose "Ad" as the card type</li>
          <li>Select an image for your card and fill in title, description, and the URL for your website</li>
          <li>Choose the option to pay readers who open your card</li>
          <li>Choose how much you want to spend per day, and locations where you want it to run</li>
          <li>Click Publish to start running it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>New users are automatically granted a small balance to get started. And so you'll start getting clicks without having
          to have paid anything out of your pocket. Your balance will get exhausted quickly. Then you can decide whether
          you want to top it up by buying coins. Tap on the top-right corner to visit your Balance page and then tap on "buy
          coins".
        </p>
        <p>Wasn't that easy?</p>
