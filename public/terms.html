        <div class="lastUpdated">Last updated: 1/12/2018</div>
        <p>
          <b>Proceed with caution.</b> Channels is new and we offer no guarantees whatsoever. Any investment in time or money
          you make in Channels could be lost at any time. We may choose to discontinue Channels at any time.
          <b>Any balance and content we are holding for you could be lost.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Our guiding principle</b>: We operate with a high ethical standard and we expect every community member to do the
          same.
          <b>We will protect the integrity of the platform ruthlessly.</b>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:30px;">Channels is only for those at least 18 years of age, or those who are at least 13 years of age under the direct supervision
          of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
        <p>By using Channels, you agree to do so at your own risk and agree not to hold Channels, Hivepoint, or any of its employees
          or investors liable for any direct or indirect loss you may incur or damage you may suffer.</p>
        <p>We cannot be held responsible for harm resulting from content posted by others on Channels. We may or may not verify
          the identity of authors who post content, so consumers must be cautious about its origin.
        </p>
        <p>You must use your real identity on Channels. This can be an individual or a bona fide organization.</p>
        <p>You may not use any copyrighted material when posting on Channels unless you own that copyright or have permission
          to use it.</p>
        <p>You may not use artificial means to drive traffic to your content or engage others to do this. That includes the
          use of bots, work automation services (such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Clickworker, CrowdFlower, JobBoy, or any
          similar service), or other means that we deem inappropriate at our discretion.
        </p>
        <p>You may not directly or indirectly offer rewards to others as a way to drive traffic to your content.</p>
        <p>You may only promote your content on or off of Channels in a misleading way.
        </p>
        <p>You may not post any sexually explicit, violent, or other content that is in appropriate. We will determine what
          is appropriate at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your content.</p>
        <p>Channels does not store your keys or password on our system. Therefore, if you lose these, we may not be able to
          help you retrieve them. You may optionally provide your email address when registering, in which case we may be
          able to assist you in recovering your account, but make no guarantees. If you provide your email address, your
          account may only be as secure as is your email account.</p>
        <p>ChannelCoin is an intangible digital asset. The value of ChannelCoin tokens can be changed at any time at our discretion
          without advance warning.</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for determining, collecting or paying any income or sales taxes. Depending on your jurisdiction,
          it is up to you to determine whether any such taxes are relevant and to report and pay them accordingly.</p>
        <p>You may only use Channels if it is legal within your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that Channels collects 10% of the tokens paid by consumers to card authors. We reserve the right
          to change these fees and to add other fees at any time without advance notice.</p>
        <p>We provide no guarantees about the reliability of the platform and will not be held responsible for bugs and errors
          in its operation.</p>
        <p>We will not share any information you provide us with any third party other than as part of this service itself (such
          as attaching the author's identity to cards).</p>
        <p>We will do our best to protect information you share with us.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change any aspect of Channels at any time without notice.
        </p>
        <p>We have complete discretion to determine, without justification, when you are not complying with our terms of service
          and may take any action we deem appropriate including, but not limited to, blocking content, banning accounts,
          closing accounts, disabling payments, withholding payouts. We may do this with or without notice to you.</p>
