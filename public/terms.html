        <p>
          <b>Proceed with caution.</b> Channels is new and we offer no guarantees whatsoever. Any investment in time or money
          you make in Channels could be lost at any time. We may choose to discontinue Channels at any time.
          <b>Any balance and content we are holding for you could be lost.</b>
        </p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change any aspect of Channels at any time without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>With this in mind...</i>
        </p>
        <p>Channels is only for those at least 18 years of age, or those who are at least 13 years of age under the direct supervision
          of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
        <p>By using Channels, you agree to do so at your own risk and agree not to hold Channels, Hivepoint, or any of its employees
          or investors liable for any direct or indirect loss you may incur or damage you may suffer.</p>
        <p>If you register with Channels, you agree to use your real identity, as an individual or an organization easily found
          on the internet.</p>
        <p>We cannot be held responsible for harm resulting from content posted by others on Channels. We do not verify the
          identity of authors who post content, so consumers must be cautious about its origin.
        </p>
        <p>By using Channels, you agree not to circumvent normal transactions or operations in any way or to access information
          from Channels except for its normal primary purpose. You may not use multiple identities or programmatic access
          without written permission.
        </p>
        <p>Channels does not store your keys or password on our system. Therefore, if you lose these, we may not be able to
          help you retrieve them. You may optionally provide your email address when registering, in which case we may be
          able to assist you in recovering your account, but make no guarantees. If you provide your email address, your
          account may only be as secure as is your email account.</p>
        <p>ChannelCoin is an intangible digital asset. The value of ChannelCoin tokens can be changed at any time at our discretion
          without advance warning.</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for determining, collecting or paying any income or sales taxes. Depending on your jurisdiction,
          it is up to you to determine whether any such taxes are relevant and to report and pay them accordingly.</p>
        <p>You may only use Channels if it is legal within your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that Channels collects 10% of the tokens paid by consumers to card authors. We reserve the right
          to change these fees and to add other fees at any time without advance notice.</p>
        <p>We provide no guarantees about the reliability of the platform and will not be held responsible for bugs and errors
          in its operation.</p>
        <p>We will not share any information you provide us with any third party other than as part of this service itself (such
          as attaching the author's identity to cards).</p>
        <p>We will do our best to protect information you share with us.</p>
